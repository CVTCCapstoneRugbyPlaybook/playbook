    <p class="lead" id = "leftAlign">  The Field of play is the area (as shown on the plan) between the goal lines and the touchlines. These lines are not part of the field of play.
      The Playing Area is the field of play and the in-goal areas (as shown on the plan). The touchlines, touch-in-goal lines and dead ball lines are not part of the playing area.
      The Playing Enclosure is the playing area and a space around it, not less than 5 metres where practicable, which is known as the perimeter area.
      In-goal is the area between the goal line and the dead ball line, and between the touch-in-goal lines. It includes the goal line but it does not include the dead ball line or the touch-in-goal lines.
      ‘The 22’ is the area between the goal line and the 22-metre line, including the 22-metre line but excluding the goal line.
      The Plan, including all the words and figures on it, is part of the Laws.

    The game may be played on snow, provided the snow and underlying surface are safe to play on. It shall not be a permanently 
    hard surface such as concrete or asphalt. In the case of artificial grass surfaces, they must conform to World Rugby Regulation 22.</p>

         representative team of a Union against the senior or next senior national representative team of another Union; and<br>
         &nbsp  &nbsp  &nbsp (ii) International seven-a-side matches;
