           For safty reason, you cannot make contact above the sholders.<br>
           A penalty will be issued if a referee sees a high tackle.<br>
           A yellow card and a spell in the sin-bin or a red card and instant dismissal 
           may be given for more serious offences.

          <p class = "lead" id = "leftAlign">
            Once a player in possession of the ball has been brought 
            to ground by a tackler, they must release the ball immediately.<br>
            This can done by either by passing off to a team-mate or placing the ball on the ground.<br>
            If they do not release the ball immediately and roll away from it, they will concede a penalty.<br>
            <br>
            The tackler must release the player they have just brought down and 
            roll away from them and the ball.<br>
            If the referee believes the tackler has not rolled away quick enough, 
            he will award a penalty to the opposition.<br>
          </p>
          
          <h4 id = "leftAlign">Stealing the ball in the tackle</h4>
          <p class = "lead" id = "leftAlign">
             A team-mate of the tackler can pick up the ball from the 
             contact area as long as they are on their feet.<br>
             As soon as a team-mate from the ball carrier's side comes into contact with that player and 
             the ball is still on the ground, the tackle then becomes a ruck.<br>
             None of the tackler's team-mates can attempt to handle or pick up the
             ball once the ruck has formed.<br>
          </p>
          
          <h4 id = "leftAlign">Other laws concerning tackling</h4>
          <p class = "lead" id = "leftAlign">
            If a player has been tackled and their natural momentum takes them over 
            the try-line and the ball is grounded, a try is awarded.<br>
            A player tackled near the goal-line can also reach out and attempt to 
            touch the ball down for a try.<br>
            If the ball carrier has been held by an opponent, but has not gone to ground, 
            and a team-mate has bound onto them, a maul is formed. At that point a tackle
            cannot be made for safety reasons.<br>
