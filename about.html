            <p id="leftAlign" class="lead">Often called the "game played in heaven." 
            Rugby is a full-contact sport that evolved from football (i.e. soccer). 
            Rugby is a free-flowing game which requires a combination strength, speed 
            and strategy to move a ball into an opponents territory.</p>

            football played at English public schools in the 19th century.Rugby was developed in

            <p id="leftAlign" class="lead">The Ancient Greeks and Romans are known to have played 
            a ball game that involved the use of their feet. There is a Roman game called harpastum 
            which is believed to have been adapted from a Greek team game known as Episkyros or 
            phaininda. The games appear to have resembled rugby football.</p>

            <h1 id="rightAlign">The rest is history.</h1>
            <p id="rightAlign" class="lead">In 1871, English clubs met to form the Rugby Football 
            Union (RFU). In 1892, the existing rugby union authorities responded to charges of 
            professionalism made against some clubs for paying players for missing work. Sanctions 
            were issued against the clubs, players, and officials involved in the new organization, 
            commonly refered to as the Northern Union (NU) or Northern Rugby Football Union. Separate 
            clubs were formed and named "rugby league" and "rugby union".</p>

            <h1 id="leftAlign">Rugby ball.</h1>
            <p id="leftAlign" class="lead">An official rugby union ball is oval and made of four 
            panels. It has a length in-line of 280–300 millimetres, a circumference, end to end, of 
            740–770 millimetres, and a circumference, in width, of 580–620 millimetres. The ball is 
            made of leather or suitable synthetic material, and may be treated to make it water 
            resistant and easier to grip. The weight of a rugby ball may not be more than 460 grams 
            or less than 410 and has an air pressure of 65.71–68.75 kilopascals, or 0.67–0.70 kilograms 
            per square centimetre, or 9.5–10.0 lbs per square inch.</p>

          <h1 id="rightAlign">Rugby uniform.</h1>
          <p id="rightAlign" class="lead">Rugby shirts were formerly made of cotton but are now 
          made of a cotton and polyester mix. This material has the advantage of not absorbing as much 
          water or mud as cotton alone. The rugby jerseys are slightly different depending on the type 
          of rugby game played. 
          
          The shirts worn by rugby league players commonly have a large "V" around the neck. The players in 
          rugby union wear jerseys with a more traditional design. The number of the player and his or her 
          surname are placed on the upper back of the jersey, and the logo of the team on the upper left chest.</p>
